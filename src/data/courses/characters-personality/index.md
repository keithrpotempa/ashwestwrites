Writing a dynamic character requires a number of factors. Goals and motivations. Background and upbringing. Inner demons and the journey toward profound positive change. But most importantly, they must behave, think and act in a convincing and consistent enough fashion to appear to be real living people. This course seeks to break down these components through use of the heuristic Enneagram model of human personality, mythic character archetypes, wisdom and techniques of highly accomplished authors, so that students can create convincing, dynamic characters and set them up for journeys of self discovery and change. The course will include lecture, group discussion, in-class readings, take-home writing prompts, as well as private and small-group exercises. All levels of skill and experience are welcome.
