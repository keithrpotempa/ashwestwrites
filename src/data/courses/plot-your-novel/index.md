The plot of an entire novel is a daunting thing to chew. In this course students will cut that meal into manageable pieces without compromising any of the unique flavors within. Students will learn the basics of story plotting, and then examine three established story structures used by accomplished authors and screenwriters. Each student will create their own novel concept (or enhance an existing one), develop a full outline of its plot, and have it critiqued by the class using the skills and techniques taught during the course. This course is open to all levels of experience.
