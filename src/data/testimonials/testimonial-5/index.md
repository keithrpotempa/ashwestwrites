“[Ashton West] clearly is well educated in his craft. I don't think it possible to exhaust all he knows and could convey - even if the course had been several years long. In the time available he taught the material effectively, and provided many keen and helpful insights concerning the rough ideas I submitted outside of class. He's an excellent teacher.”
